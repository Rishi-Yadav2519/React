## 📂 Your Phase 2 Files

You have **3 files** in this folder:

1. **00_START_HERE.md** ← You are here! Read this first
2. **PHASE_2_GUIDE.md** ← Project requirements (no code)
3. **CODE_REFERENCE.md** ← Syntax examples for Phase 2 hooks
4. **PROGRESS_TRACKER.md** ← Track your daily progress

## 📖 How to Use These Files

### 1️⃣ **PHASE_2_GUIDE.md** - Your Roadmap
- Contains **5 mini-projects + 1 capstone**
- Lists WHAT to build (requirements)
- NO code solutions (learn by doing!)
- Read requirements → Build independently

### 2️⃣ **CODE_REFERENCE.md** - Your Syntax Guide
- Contains **ALL Phase 2 syntax examples**
- useEffect, useContext, useMemo, Custom Hooks
- API fetching patterns
- When stuck on syntax → Look here
- DON'T copy-paste, understand then apply

### 3️⃣ **PROGRESS_TRACKER.md** - Your Checklist
- Daily progress tracker
- Check off items as you complete
- Track scores and completion dates
- See your improvement!

## 🎯 Phase 2 Learning Path

### Mini-Projects (2-4 hours each):
1. **Live Clock** - useEffect, cleanup, setInterval
2. **Data Fetching Dashboard** - API calls, loading states
3. **Theme Switcher** - useContext, global state
4. **Search with Debouncing** - useMemo, optimization
5. **Custom Hook** - useLocalStorage, reusability

### Capstone (1-2 weeks):
**Weather App** - Combines ALL Phase 2 concepts

## 🛠️ What You'll Learn

### Phase 2 Concepts:
- ✅ **useEffect** - Side effects, cleanup, dependencies
- ✅ **useContext** - Global state management
- ✅ **useMemo** - Performance optimization
- ✅ **Custom Hooks** - Reusable logic
- ✅ **API Integration** - Fetch data, loading/error states
- ✅ **Advanced Patterns** - Real-world React

## 📋 Your Workflow

**For Each Project:**

1. **Read Requirements** (in PHASE_2_GUIDE.md)
   - What to build?
   - What features needed?

2. **Create Vite Project**
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest project-name -- --template react
   cd project-name
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Check Syntax** (in CODE_REFERENCE.md when stuck)
   - How does useEffect work?
   - What's the syntax for useContext?

4. **Build Independently**
   - Write code yourself
   - No copy-pasting
   - Learn by doing

5. **Submit for Review**
   - Tell me when ready
   - Get detailed feedback
   - Receive score out of 100

6. **Update Progress** (I'll do this for you)
   - Mark completed
   - Record score
   - Add notes
