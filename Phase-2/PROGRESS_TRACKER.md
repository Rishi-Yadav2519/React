## 📋 Mini Project 2.3: Theme Switcher with useContext

**Status:** ✅ Completed

### Requirements Checklist

**Functional Requirements:**
- ✅ Toggle button switches themes
- ✅ Theme applies globally (Header, Content, Footer)
- ✅ Light theme: White bg, black text

- ✅ useContext in all child components
- ✅ No prop drilling
- ✅ State managed in provider

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Clean context setup
- ✅ Well-organized components
- ✅ Professional styling
- ✅ No console errors

### Submission Details
- **Submitted:** February 2, 2026 (Updated)
- **Marks Obtained:** 94/100
- **Feedback:** Good improvement! You added content text and proper padding, showing theme switching works. However, 3 optimizations were suggested but not implemented: (1) Encapsulate theme state inside ThemeProvider instead of App (-3pts), (2) Use useLayoutEffect instead of useEffect for no-flash behavior (-1pt), (3) Pass theme value through context along with toggle (-1pt). Content still minimal (only 1 line) - could add multiple cards to showcase better (-2pts). Score improved from 91→94. You're learning Context API well! For 97-100, implement the 3 remaining optimizations. 🌟
