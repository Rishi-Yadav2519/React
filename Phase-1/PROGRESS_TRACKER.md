## 📝 Personal Notes

### What I learned: 
I learnt multiple things about React in Phase 1. Starting from the basics of components and JSX to more advanced topics like state management with useState, handling events, and working with forms and validation. I also procticed Tailwind CSS for styling which made my projects look professional and responsive.
_______________________________________________________

### Most challenging concept:
Managaing a actual for mwith validation where multiple fields needed to be controlled components was quite challenging and I also got stuck on conditional rendering in few projects initially.
_______________________________________________________

### Most exciting feature I built:
The Student Dashboard capstone project was the most exciting feature I built as it combined all the concepts I learned in Phase 1. Implementing the search and filter functionality together, along with the dual view toggle between card and list views, made it a comprehensive and engaging project.
_______________________________________________________

### Areas I need to improve:
I need to improve the speed of my coding and also focus on writing more comments in my code to enhance readability. Additionally, I want to work on conditional rendering and other topics where I faced challenges to gain more confidence.
_______________________________________________________

### Questions for next phase:
Just start the next phase and keep the learning momentum going.
