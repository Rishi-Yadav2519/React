## 📂 You Have 4 Files ONLY - That's It!

**Read in this order:**

1. ✅ **START_HERE.md** ← You're reading this
2. **PHASE_1_GUIDE.md** ← Your learning guide (open next)
3. **CODE_REFERENCE.md** ← Syntax help (when stuck)
4. **PROGRESS_TRACKER.md** ← Track your progress

**All other files are deleted. Too confusing. Focus on these 4.**

## ⏱️ Quick Summary

**What you'll build in Phase 1:**
- 4 mini-projects (2-3 hours each)
- 1 capstone project (1-2 weeks)
- Total: 3 weeks

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: 3 mini-projects
- Week 2: 1 mini-project + plan capstone
- Week 3: Build capstone + submit

## 💡 How This Works

**I will NOT give you code.** Here's why:

❌ Code given → You copy → No learning  
✅ You struggle → You solve → Deep learning

**What you GET:**
- Clear requirements (what to build)
- Concept guidance (what to learn)
- CODE_REFERENCE.md (syntax examples)
- Code reviews (feedback on YOUR code)

---

## 🎯 Phase 1: React Fundamentals

**Learn these concepts:**
- Components & JSX
- Props (passing data)
- State (useState hook)
- Events & forms
- Conditional rendering
- Lists & filtering
- CSS styling

**Build 4 projects:**
1. **Dynamic Greeting Card** - Learn: JSX, props, conditionals
2. **Button Counter** - Learn: State, events
3. **User List** - Learn: Arrays, mapping, filtering
4. **Form Input** - Learn: Forms, validation

**Then build 1 capstone:**
5. **Student Dashboard** - Combine everything
